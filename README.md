This is a mirror repository for our discord bot Yoru. 

Yoru is a NSFW and Moderation/Utility bot for your discord server. This repository contains some of the main source code for the bot, but it will not allow you to fully run the bot from scratch. We will not help with self-configuring the bot and recommend you use the live production version of the bot, however you are free to try. If you have any problems with the production build you can send us bug reports in our issues [tab](https://github.com/lewd-labs/yoru-mirror/issues). If you have self hosting problems please join a programming discord server. Our [LICENSE](https://github.com/lewd-labs/yoru-mirror/blob/main/LICENSE) can be found here. Feel free to join our community's and meet other developers as well!
